# Half_Duplex_Chatroom
This is a basic half duplex chatroom which can be used on your local network. The server side listens for a connection and
once a request is received it sends a message to the client confirming the connection. This shows that the chatroom has been
initialised and messages can be sent and recieved. 
Although these programs only allow for one message to be sent by either of the parties at a given point of time, this can be
improved upon by using threading to make this a duplex chatroom.
